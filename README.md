# CricInfo


The basic motto of this application is to provide information about cricket players and IPL teams to users. Filters are made according to the traits of the players and teams in the given dataset.

There are two types of views in this application

 - <b>Without filters:</b> Displays all the players/teams and when clicked on one shows a detailed description of player/team in the form of a customized modal.
 - <b>With any filter:</b> To provide two views of the same page, I wrote logic deliberatly that when user clicks "Apply" in filter, the page shows message of "No results found". This is solely created to show my skills in UI/UX design.
